A basic digital clock which runds the terminal.

Each digit is represented as an array of strings. It uses the current time to decide which digits to use and displays them in the terminal. The clock runs on an infinite loop which updates every second (uses time.Sleep()).

The screen clears every seconds and moves the cursor back to the top left so the clock is redrawn inplace each time.
